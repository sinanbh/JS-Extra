    <h3>1)  What is Javascript?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Javascript is a dynamic programming language and it is the most popular language in the world wide. It is highest pid job in U.S or other countries. It is used everywhere now (Web Apps,Mobile Apps, Netflix, walmart, Paypal).</p>

    <h3>2) What is Javascript RunTime Environment?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong> The runtime environment is what makes JavaScript code work, and in a browser in consists of the JS engine, a lot of Web APIs, a callback queue and the event loop.</p>
    
    <h3>3) What is Javascript Engine?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong> JavaScript is not understandable by computer but the only browser understands JavaScript. So, we need a program to convert our JavaScript program into computer-understandable language. A JavaScript engine is a computer program that executes JavaScript code and converts it into computer understandable language.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Parser: It checks for syntax and semantics. Parser is nothing but a lexical analysis that results into the breaking of code into tokens in order to understand their meanings and these tokens gets converted into Abstract Syntax Tree(AST).</li>
        <li>Abstract Syntax tree: It is a hierarchical tree like structure of program representation which allows interpreter to understand the program. This AST is initially goes to the Interpreter.</li>
        <li>Interpreter: It lets the AST to get converted into Byte code. In V8 engine, this process is known as Ignition but when some code gets repeated again and again.</li>
        <li>Profiler: It will check for the repeating code that can be optimized. As soon as, it gets the repeating code, it basically moves the code into compiler.</li>
        <li>Compiler: It spits out the most optimized byte code.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>4) What is Execution in Javascript?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong> Execution Context is an abstract concept that hold information about the environment where current coe is being executed.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>A default execution context is created when browser loads javascript code known as Global execution context. Also it is pushed into Call stack.</li>
        <li>It has 2 phases: Memory Creation Phase and Code Execution Phase.</li>
        <li>In Memory Phase, variable and function declarations are stored in the memory. value of variables declared with var is assigned to undefined.</li>
        <li>Profiler: It will check for the repeating code that can be optimized. As soon as, it gets the repeating code, it basically moves the code into compiler.</li>
    </ol>
