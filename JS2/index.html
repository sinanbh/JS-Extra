    <h3>1) Difference between var, let and const. </h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong>     
    <ol>
        <li>var is global or functional scope. It can be reassigned. It can be redeclared.</li>
        <li>let is block scoped. It can be reassigned. It cannot be redeclared.</li>
        <li>const is vlock scoped. It cannot be reassigned. It cannot be redeclared. Have to assign value with declaration itself.</li>
    </ol>

    <pre>  
        console.log("---var---");
        var a=5;
        var a=10;
        console.log(a);      //5   //10

        console.log("---let---");
        let a=10;
        let a=20;      //we cannot redeclare.
        console.log(a);   //10    //error

        console.log("---const---");
        const a=10;
        a=20;
        console.log(a);  //throws error that assigned to fixed value (cannot be modified).
    </pre>


    <h3>2) What is Hoisting?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong> It is deafult Javascript Mechanism when our variables and functions declarations are moved to top of their scope before the code execution.</p>
    <pre>
        console.log("---Hoisting---");
        a=10;
        console.log(a);   //10
        var a;   // var a appears to move to the top of its scope.
    </pre>


    <h3>3) What is Temperal Dead Zone?</h3>
    <p><strong>Ans:</strong> The time between the variables hoisted and the variables get initialized is called the Temperal Dead Zone.</p>

    <pre>
        console.log("---Temperal Dead Zone---");
        console.log(a);   //undefined
        console.log(b);   //Cannot access 'b' before initialization
        var a=10;
        let b=20;
    </pre>
